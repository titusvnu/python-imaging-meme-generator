# Python Imaging Meme Generator

## Description
This is a Python-based meme generator tool built using **PyQt5** for the GUI and **Pillow (PIL)** for image processing. Developed during my 8th-grade year in mid-2021, the project enables users to create custom memes by overlaying text onto popular meme templates.

## Features
- **PyQt5 GUI Interface:** Simple, user-friendly design.
- **Common Meme Formats:** Includes templates like the Drake meme and more.
- **Custom Text Input:** Allows users to add personalized captions.
- **Image Processing with Pillow:** Handles text placement and rendering on images.
- **Push Notifications (Optional):** Basic notification support included.
